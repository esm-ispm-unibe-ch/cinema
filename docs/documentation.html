   Below you can find a brief guide of using CINeMA to evaluate confidence
   <br/>
   in network meta-analysis treatment effects.
  </p>
  <h1 id="my-projects">
   My projects

  <p>
   CINeMA requires a .csv file with the study
   <strong>
    outcome
   </strong>
   data and study-level
   <br/>
   <strong>
    risk of bias
   </strong>
   (RoB) and
   <strong>
    indirectness
   </strong>
   judgements which you can upload in My Projects. We
   <br/>
   describe below how the data should be formatted.

  <p>
   If your outcome is binary, there are two possible formats to upload your
   <br/>
   data. The first is a long format, where each treatment arm occupies one
   <br/>
   row.

   In the second format, each row represents a comparison. The number of

   rows that each study occupies equals the number of comparisons that it examines.
   <br/>
   Two arm studies (studies with two treatment arms) occupy one

   row, three arm studies occupy three rows, four arm studies occupy six

   rows etc.

   <br/>
   provided on the dataset.
  </p>
  <h1 id="imprecision">
   Imprecision
  </h1>
  <p>
   Importance of imprecise treatment effects depends on whether their
   <br/>
   confidence intervals include values that could lead into different
   <br/>
   clinical decisions. You need to specify a clinically important size of
   <br/>
   effect on the scale of your effect measure. After pressing ‘Set’ the
   <br/>
   range of values to be considered as clinically important appear. As a
   <br/>
   default, imprecision judgements are formulated as follows: we
   <br/>
   characterize as very serious in terms of imprecision network estimates
   <br/>
   whose confidence intervals cross both limits of the clinically important
   <br/>
   effects zone. If only one of the two values is crossed by network
   <br/>
   estimates’ confidence intervals they are characterized as serious and
   <br/>
   not serious applies to those estimates that do not cross neither value.
   <br/>
   The hypothetical forest plot below serves as an illustration of the
   <br/>
   strategy we apply to judge upon imprecision of network treatment effects
   <br/>
   based on a clinically important odds ratio of 0.8.
  </p>
  <p>
   <img alt="" src="images/impr.png"/>
  </p>
  <h1 id="heterogeneity">
   Heterogeneity
  </h1>
  <p>
   Importance of heterogeneity depends on the variability of effects in
   <br/>
   relation to the clinically important size of effect. The clinically
   <br/>
   important value needs to be the same as in Imprecision; if already
   <br/>
   specified it will automatically appear on the top of Heterogeneity.
   <br/>
   Otherwise, it needs to be specified here and will be inherited in
   <br/>
   Imprecision. We make use of prediction intervals to prepopulate
   <br/>
   judgments on heterogeneity and its implications on the quality of the
   <br/>
   network treatment effects. In particular, we judge the agreement of
   <br/>
   conclusions based on confidence and prediction intervals in relation to
   <br/>
   the clinically important effect size. Our judgements based on a
   <br/>
   hypothetical clinically important odds ratio of 0.8 are summarized and
   <br/>
   illustrated in the table and in the figure below.
  </p>
  <p>
   We measure the number of crossings of the confidence and prediction interval with the clinical important interval and judge their agreement using the following table:
  </p>
  <p>
   |0 Prediction interval crossings | 1 Prediction interval crossings | 2 Prediction interval crossings |
   <br/>
   -----------------------------|   |   |  |
   <br/>
   <strong>
    0 Confidence interval crossings
   </strong>
   | No serious | Serious    | Very serious
   <br/>
   <strong>
    1 Confidence interval crossings
   </strong>
   | NA         | No serious | Serious
   <br/>

    2   Confidence interval crossings

   | NA         | NA         | No serious

  </p>
  <p>
   The estimated value of between-study variance for the network
   <br/>
   meta-analysis is displayed. It is also possible to view between-study
   <br/>
   variance estimates for each direct comparison along with reference
   <br/>

   ,
   <a href="#Rhodes">

   </a>
   ]. If critical appraisal of those lead to changing conclusions
   <br/>
   formulated by considerations based on predictive intervals, users can
   <br/>
   amend heterogeneity judgments manually.
  </p>
  <h1 id="incoherence">
   Incoherence
  </h1>
  <p>
   We propose assessing incoherence both globally (using the design by
   <br/>
   treatment interaction model [
   <a href="#White">
    3
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="#Higgins">
    4
   </a>
   ]) and locally (using the side splitting
   <br/>
   approach [
   <a href="#Dias">
    5
   </a>
   ]). Below, we describe the rules we use to prepopulate our
   <br/>
   incoherence judgements.
  </p>
  <p>
   We judge comparisons that only direct evidence exists as ‘no serious’
   <br/>
   with respect to incoherence. For comparisons that only indirect
   <br/>
   evidence exists, we judge incoherence as ‘no serious’, ‘serious’ and
   <br/>
   ‘very serious’ depending on whether the p-value of the design by
   <br/>
   treatment interaction model is more 0.10, between 0.01 and 0.10 and less
   <br/>
   than 0.01 respectively. In a similar to Heterogeneity manner we make use of confidence intervals of direct and indirect estimates to examine whether they agree.
   <br/>
   To classify their agreement we partition into three areas:
   <br/>
   - left from the clinically important zone A
   <br/>
   - the clinically important zone itself B
   <br/>
   - right from the clinically important zone C
   <br/>
   An interval belongs to A and/or B and/or C areas.
   <br/>
   One can define the boolean vector {a,b,c} describing the intervals
   <br/>
   positioning.
   <br/>
   In order to judge Incoherence we decided to look at the agreement of the direct
   <br/>
   and indirect estimates concerning their positioning relative to the clinically important value.
   <br/>
   The following table shows the 4 cases that the direct and indirect intervals can be found by expressing the number of areas they have in common, as well as the judgement implied.
