*<span class="fontcinema">CINeMA</span> (Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis) is a web application that simplifies the evaluation of confidence in the findings from network meta-analysis.*

It is based on a methodological framework described in [[1]](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0099682) which considers six domains: **within-study bias**, **across-studies bias**, **indirectness**,  **imprecision**, ** heterogeneity** and **incoherence**.
Key to the <span class="fontcinema">CINeMA</span>'s methodology is the percentage **contribution matrix**, which shows how much information each study contributes to the results from network meta-analysis.
