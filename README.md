## CINeMA 

## Description
CINeMA *Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis* is a web application that simplifies the evaluation of confidence in the findings from network meta-analysis.

It is based on a framework described in (1) which considers the five GRADE domains: study limitations, indirectness, inconsistency, imprecision and publication bias. The framework combines judgments about direct evidence with their statistical contribution to network meta-analysis results, enabling evaluation of the credibility of NMA treatment effects.
